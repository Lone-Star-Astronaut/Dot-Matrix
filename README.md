LED Dot-Matrix

This project is created to use the MAX7219 IC to drive LED 8x8 matrices to display scrolling text messages.
An Arduino UNO is used to communicate to the MAX7219 using a SPI interface. 

This project is still a work in progress. PCB layout and 3D printed enclosure files will be included as part of the project.
